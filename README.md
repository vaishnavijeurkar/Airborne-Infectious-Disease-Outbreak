# Airborne-Infectious-Disease-Outbreak
## Project Title: Tactical Resource Deployment Analysis in Medical Emergencies

## Description:
This project focuses on leveraging supercomputer simulation data of an airborne infectious disease outbreak across Manchester. The objective is to create visualizations aiding time-critical decision-makers, such as gold command police officers, army commanders, or government officials in COBR meetings, to strategically deploy limited medical resources based on the data analysis.

The dataset consists of 250 simulation outputs, representing the spread of the epidemic under varying environmental conditions, considering wind direction and speed. Each file provides estimates of infected individuals across a grid of cells within the city. The analysis utilizes mean infection rates and measures of variance (variance, standard deviation, index of dispersion, coefficient of variation) to represent impact and uncertainty levels.

## Key Features:
- Utilizes supercomputer simulation data of an airborne infectious disease outbreak in Manchester.
- Provides visualizations aiding rapid decision-making for resource deployment in medical emergencies.
- Employs mean infection rates and variance measures to indicate impact and uncertainty in different city cells.
- Incorporates latitude and longitude data to pinpoint outbreak origin for better contextual understanding.
